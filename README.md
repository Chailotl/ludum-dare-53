# Bunpacking
Me and a friend submitted a game for Ludum Dare 53! This was my first time participating in Ludum Dare, I wrote the code and my friend made the assets. The theme was delivery, so we made this cute game about a postbunny trying to deliver packages whilst avoiding raccoons who are trying to snatch away your parcels
